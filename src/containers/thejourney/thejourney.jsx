              Our entire life when we shop, we are limited by the choices in the
              store .We are ofter on the side where we buy our favourite colored
              shoes made by someone wlse but what if we designed it? What if we
              could involve in the making of a shoe we want to buy? This little
              thought sprouted to become what er are today, KICKSUP! ;)

              Understanding the trends in the industry and what the users think
              when they buy where our top priorities before we move furthur to
              the building. after weeks of fruitful research, we steped into the
              users shoes and look at what we plan to do. its a reat joy for the
              users if they are involved in the making. we are heading into an
              era of technology and people prefer online shoping to shopping i
              an outlet.

              Every milestone begins with a single step and before KICKSUP
              sprouted, the team manufactured in small scale with 2 users a
              month.this experience was crucial to our brand as this is our
              frist practial experience. Interacting with the users was the best
              thing ever.the positive reviews and the support from people
              motivated us to push our limits furthur.
